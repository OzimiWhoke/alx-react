# React Immutable

In object-oriented (OO) and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable[1] object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object's state appears unchanging from an external point of view. For example, an object that uses memoization to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object.
